                <p>
                    I'm Jesse. I spent the last five years experimenting with making my own barefoot sandals. I feel I have found the right design and materials and would like to share the result with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One difficulty I had was finding good materials to make the sandals. I would like to make this step easier for you by offering all the necessary materials in one barefoot sandal making kit.
                </p>

                    <li> Hole punch</li>
                </ul>
