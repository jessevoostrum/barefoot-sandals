                    Hi there, you can buy the materials for making your own barefoot sandals <a href="checkout.html"> here</a>.

                <p>
                    I'm Jesse. I spent the last five years experimenting with making my own barefoot sandals. I feel I have found the right design and materials and would like to share the result with you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One difficulty was finding the right materials to make them. I would like to make this step a bit easier for you by offering all the necessary materials in one barefoot sandal making kit.
